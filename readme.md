A helper for unique portal collectors. If you ever forgot to bring IITC-mobile with you, there might be missing entries in your uniques database. This tool can help you "backfill" those.

How to use:

1. Retrieve your game data dump from Niantic. Just mention the GDPR policy and they will happily send you the data.
2. Run the script, it will generate data.txt. It contains all portals you ever captured and visited.
3. Open IITC and paste the data.txt into your browser console
4. Zoom to a region containing portals you want to update and paste command.txt into the console. Repeat in a different location until happy.
